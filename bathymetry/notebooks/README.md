The Jupyter Notebooks in this directory are for development and testing of
the bathymetry (IDEALIZED and REALISTIC) used in the Mackenzie NEMO model configuration.

The links below are to static renderings of the notebooks via
[nbviewer.jupyter.org](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/).
Descriptions under the links below are from the first cell of the notebooks
(if that cell contains Markdown or raw text).
