The Jupyter Notebooks in this directory are for development and testing of
the bathymetry (IDEALIZED and REALISTIC) used in the Mackenzie NEMO model configuration.

The links below are to static renderings of the notebooks via
[nbviewer.jupyter.org](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/).
Descriptions under the links below are from the first cell of the notebooks
(if that cell contains Markdown or raw text).

    This notebook reviews and modifies the functions used to create the bathymetry profiles of a shelf, slope, and canyon. The original functions can be found in https://bitbucket.org/canyonsubc/buildcanyon/src/f2380a66a5fe4fc9e373e46f409a57c5fa4b8f9d/PythonModulesMITgcm/BathyPythonTools.py.

    Generate a bathymetry file (as well as delx and dely files) with non uniform resolution for two identical consecutive canyons. Minimum resolution is 200 m near the canyons along shore and across shore.
