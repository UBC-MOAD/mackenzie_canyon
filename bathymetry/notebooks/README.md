The Jupyter Notebooks in this directory are for development and testing of
the bathymetry (IDEALIZED and REALISTIC) used in the Mackenzie NEMO model configuration.

The links below are to static renderings of the notebooks via
[nbviewer.jupyter.org](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/).
Descriptions under the links below are from the first cell of the notebooks
(if that cell contains Markdown or raw text).

    May: Part 1 - Notes and results of the original GYRE configuration **GYRE_Test**, second set of configurations **attempt1** where bathymetry and forcing are tested, third set of configurations **attempt2** where the forcing was changed, and the first Mackenzie Canyon run **gyre_mackenzie01**.
