* ##[figures_upwelling_events.ipynb](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/urls/bitbucket.org/CanyonsUBC/mackenzie_canyon/raw/tip/conditions/notebooks/figures_upwelling_events.ipynb)  
    
    This notebook shows the development of functions used to visualize the circulation during upwelling events.  

* ##[winds_analytical_formula.ipynb](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/urls/bitbucket.org/CanyonsUBC/mackenzie_canyon/raw/tip/conditions/notebooks/winds_analytical_formula.ipynb)  
    
    This notebook is used to create and test new wind forcing patterns in sbcana.F90.  

* ##[winds_upwelling_events.ipynb](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/urls/bitbucket.org/CanyonsUBC/mackenzie_canyon/raw/tip/conditions/notebooks/winds_upwelling_events.ipynb)  
    
    This notebooks looks at the real and modelled wind stress forcing for specific upwelling events.  

* ##[winds_historical_records.ipynb](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/urls/bitbucket.org/CanyonsUBC/mackenzie_canyon/raw/tip/conditions/notebooks/winds_historical_records.ipynb)  
    
    This notebooks takes a closer look at the wind data that corresponds to available data and publications.  

* ##[vertical_eddy_viscosity.ipynb](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/urls/bitbucket.org/CanyonsUBC/mackenzie_canyon/raw/tip/conditions/notebooks/vertical_eddy_viscosity.ipynb)  
    

* ##[prepare_stratification.ipynb](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/urls/bitbucket.org/CanyonsUBC/mackenzie_canyon/raw/tip/conditions/notebooks/prepare_stratification.ipynb)  
    
    This notebook creates the temperature and salinity stratification files for a domain.

* ##[make_stratification.ipynb](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/urls/bitbucket.org/CanyonsUBC/mackenzie_canyon/raw/tip/conditions/notebooks/make_stratification.ipynb)  
    
    Simplified version of prepare_stratification.ipynb. Currently, only uses one T &S profile (#21).
